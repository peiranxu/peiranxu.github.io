I am a third-year Ph.D. student at UCLA, where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Debiao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=44m8E1MAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include **reinforcement Learning (RL) for LLM agents** and **foundation model of quantitative medical images**. 

I interned at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/) as research intern and Johns Hopkins University computer science department as Research Intern. Before joining UCLA, I got my bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
