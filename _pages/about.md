I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Debiao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=44m8E1MAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include generative AI, medical image synthesis and VLM. I have interned at CCVL@JHU advised by Prof. [Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), Prof. [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io) and Prof. [Yuyin Zhou](https://yuyinzhou.github.io). Before joining UCLA, I got my bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Outside research, I love chinese calligraphy and photography.
